# GUPIX_preprocessing
A small app for converting x-ray spectra in .MCA file format to a .DAT formatted for compatibility with GUPIX-WIN.

Run the conversionAPP.py script to use the GUI. The application will populate your folder with corresponding .DAT files along with a list of the file paths which expedites import into GUPIX. 

A test script along with test data is provided, however, it's simpler to test directly on the GUI.
